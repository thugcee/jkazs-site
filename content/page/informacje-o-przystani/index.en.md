## Booking a guest stay.

Although it rarely happens that we have to refuse someone a guest berth at our
marina due to lack of places, we meet the expectations of those of you who want
to reserve a guest berth in advance. At the same time, we would like to inform
you that we do not have any free residential places.

If you are interested in booking a place, setting a date for erecting the mast,
etc., please send your expectations to the e-mail address:
booking.azs@gmail.com. You should receive confirmation of your reservation no
later than the next business day (the office is open until 4 p.m.).

In urgent situations, when, for example, you want to make sure that parking
will be possible in the coming hours, please contact the Bosman by phone: +48
600 233 221.
